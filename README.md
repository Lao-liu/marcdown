# Marcdown

Converts markdown files to html services them

As I am new to node { var well = new ish(); } , I find that I need to read the markdown file(s) that
are associated with a modules and/or libraries. While there are some pretty good native tools around
to edit markdown, I often work best in *zen mode*, as a minimalist, using a simple text editor
and a browser.

*Marcdown* simply wraps a few of the typical node modules to help me read, write and review markdown 
content (in a browser).

## Show me the money

While it is possible to [generate a node modules links page](./packages.md) by using the dependencies 
listed in the [package.json](./package.json) file included with most projects, it is probably more 
interesting to [scan all subdirectories](./subdirs.md) of a project to gather up *markdown* files.
